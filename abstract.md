Are your apps not as engaging as you would like?  Do they look cool, function as expected, but just don't grab the attention you believe they should?  I have had that problem in a number of projects over the last 15 years of my software development career.  Recently, I have garnered a lot of attention directed to one of my most used projects.  What made the difference?  Voice prompts and alerts!  I know quality voice prompts seem like a bridge too far.  I assure you, they are not.  I will explain how this works, have live demonstrations, and how you can pronounce all of those unpronounceable words.

Are your apps not as engaging as you would like?  Do they look cool, function as expected, but just don't grab the attention you believe they should?  I have had that problem a in a number of projects over the last 15 years of my software development career.  Recently, I have garnered a lot of attention directed to one of my used projects.  It is one of my most used opensource project.  What made the difference?  Voice prompts and alerts!  I know quality voice prompts seem like a bridge too far for most.  I assure you, it is not.  I will explain how this works, show live demonstrations, and how you can pronounce all of those unpronoucible words.

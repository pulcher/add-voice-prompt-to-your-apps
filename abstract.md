# Add way cool voice prompts and alerts to you plain ol' boring app

Are you apps not as engaging as you would like?  Do they look cool, function as expected,  but just don't grab the attention you belive they should?  I have had a lot of the same problem in a number of projects over the last 15 years of my software development career.  Recently, I have garnered a lot of attention directed to one of my used projects.  It is one of my most used opensource project.  What made the difference?  Voice prompts and alerts!  I know quality voice prompts seem like a bridge too far for most.  I assure it is not.  I will explain how this works, show live demonstrations, and how you can pronounce all of those unpronoucible words.
